AirBnB Clone Project
Project Introduction: Overview of the Airbnb Clone Project

**Background Context **

Welcome to the AirBnB Clone Project! ✨

This project aims to provide you with hands-on experience in developing a simple booking and management system, using AirBnB as a case study. A well-designed booking system should offer a user-friendly UI/UX with functionalities for users to perform basic tasks.

Product Vision:

We envision a user-friendly AirBnB clone with the following key pages:

Page-1: Main Interface: This page will be the main landing page, showcasing a clean and modern layout with various property listings displayed, each with a title, price, and a brief description. The design will emphasize user-friendly navigation and visual appeal.
Page-2: Detailed Listing View: This page will show a detailed view of a specific property, highlighting key features like the property's name, location, price, amenities, and other relevant information. The interface will focus on clarity and ease of use for potential renters.
Page-3: Booking/Checkout View: This streamlined page will handle the booking or reservation process for the selected property. It may include options for selecting dates, guest count, and finalizing the booking.
